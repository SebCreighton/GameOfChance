# GameOfChance
This project combines 4 games:
- Coinflipping to see if heads or tails.
- Cho-Han - Two dice added together to see if total is odd or even.
- Simulate 2 players picking a card randomly from deck of cards.  The higher number wins.
- Roulette - Random number should be generated that determines which space the ball lands on.
